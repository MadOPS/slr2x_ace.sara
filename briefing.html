		<a name="Plan"></a> Sahrani-Life:Reloaded 2.0 by The Sahrani-Life
		Community<br> <a href="#changelog">(SL:R CHANGELOG)</a> - most
		important changes to normal SL<br>
		<br> Intro to SL:R<br> By playing on this server you
		automatically accept these server-rules:<br> <a
			href="http://slr-rpg.mh-gamerscommunity.de/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=4">SLR-RPG
			Server-Rules</a><br> The server rules can also be found at
		slr-rpg.webs.com under informations <br>
		<br> And now to the roles: <br> <br> <b>Civilian:</b><br>
		As a Civilian (or just civ) you have to obey the rules, which have
		been made by the cops and the mayor. You can break these, but then you
		have to expect to get punished. This can lead from fines to terms of
		imprisonment and in the extreme case to death, so you should obey
		those rules and behave cooperatively.<br>
		<br> <b>Police:</b><br> This briefing should enable a new
		officer to grasp the basics of being a Police officer on the
		slr-rpg.webs.com server.<br> First things first! Say hello to
		your collegues over the side chat or on
		Teamspeak3(85.214.156.250:9987). It is important you know who is in
		charge and that they know you are ‘on duty’.<br> Next, get
		equipped! The starting money is currently 12k and that means you will
		only likely be able to afford a Scoda 105 Police car. No matter as
		this is a team effort. So kit yourself out and ask the Senior officer
		where he/she would like you to patrol. You are now able to serve the
		people of Sahrani!<br> Don’t be surprised if you make mistakes –
		everyone does. However if you are making a few a senior officer might
		pair you up with an experienced officer to help you. Don’t be
		offended, they are only trying to help <br> Good luck!<br>
		<br> Some things to remember<br> - Read the Police
		information found at -
		http://slr-rpg.mh-gamerscommunity.de/viewforum.php?f=18<br> -
		Make sure to apply to the official Police Force at
		http://slr-rpg.mh-gamerscommunity.de/viewforum.php?f=18<br> -
		NON-LETHAL is priority in most cases<br> - Remember to
		communicate, either type or use Teamspeak3(85.214.156.250:9987)<br>
		- If confused please ask other officers for help <br>
